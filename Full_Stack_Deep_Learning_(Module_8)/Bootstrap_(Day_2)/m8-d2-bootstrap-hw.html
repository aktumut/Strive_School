ASSIGNMENT TOPIC
You are creating a website to showcase your favourite music albums.
In this page you will have a short biography section of yourself, and the top albums of your life, 
the worst album you ever listened to and everything related to the music you love.

ASSIGNMENT RULES
- Use Bootstrap classes to create the page.
- Use containers, rows and cols in order to achieve a great responsive layout.
- The project must be pushed to a new repository and linked in EduFlow by the end of the day.
- If you don't feel like wasting too much time on finding the pictures you can just find some of your best picks 
and then fill the rest of the page using a placeholder image like this: http://placehold.it/300
- To test the page: download Live Server, start it and inspect from the browser with developer tools and device emulator.

NOTE:
Even the most experienced designers need inspiration.
Spend some time surfing the web researching the best way of representing the albums you love.
Could be the Amazon way, the Spotify or Apple music way or any other music collection out there.

HINT: Make sure to finish the structure and responsiveness before focusing too much on details.

        /* EXERCISE 1
            For every Album we'd like to have a consistent style.
            Create a class for:
            - The album container
            - The album cover
            - The album title
            - The album group / singer / dj
            - ... and so on 

            to make sure you give every album the same consistent appearance.

    <!-- EXERCISE 2 
            Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component
            This navigation bar must link every section in your page
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
            Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.
            In this section you should have:
            - 4 albums per row when the screen is very large
            - 3 albums per row when you are on a tablet (or a smaller viewport)
            - 2 albums per row when you are on a small screen
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
            Create a section for the album reviews.
            Pick one of your fav albums, and create a section with:
            - Cover
            - Title
            - Band
            - Duration
            - Genre
            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Find out the music you don't really like or you find overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are a fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them: implement a carousel and feel free to experiment a little with this section.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
        -->

    <!-- ############ EXTRA:
        EXERCISE 9
            Create an album details area that is going to be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible) 
            (hint: look for a boostrap component that can handle the job for you.)
        -->
